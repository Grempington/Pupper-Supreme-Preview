# Pupper-Supreme
By Tomer Cohen and Liora Bar

An example E-Commerce full stack project (React-JS frontend, Express + Sqlite3 backend).
Working with Knex, can switch to a different RDBMS for deployment.

The focus of this project was to learn frontend development with React-JS.
Design was done using Fomantic-UI as a CSS framework for quick maintainable visual prototyping with my project partner.

Per modern product management and marketing, we know it's integral for starting businesses to involve themselves in social marketing.
Though this is usually done via sites like Instagram, for educational purposes, we added an in-site photo gallery:
